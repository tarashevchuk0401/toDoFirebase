                Todolist
                Simple to do list application. Created by using Angular, RxJS and Firebase. User can log in or sign up
                by email and
                password. It's possible to write some task
                and after that if necessary match as done. All done tasks will be available in separate section of
                application.
                Text of task can be edited. All changes will be saved in the data base.
